# Jasmine framework for Behavior-Driven Development

Documentation [here](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html) but also a good quick start guide to Jasmine.

List of [Matchers](https://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers )

A few tutorials:

- [Testing Your JavaScript with Jasmine](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine--net-21229) has some buggy sample tests -- as it's from 2011 -- but includes a sample test for throwing an exception.
- [Using Jasmine for JavaScript Testing ](http://blog.codeship.com/jasmine-testing-javascript/) short video tutorial
- [Unit Testing Best Practices in AngularJS](http://andyshora.com/unit-testing-best-practices-angularjs.html) has nice samples on unit and integration testing as well as discusses when to use them.

## Installation

[Download Jasmine framework](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)

Or fork this into your own project repo. I have the folders setup how I like and clone it straight into my project.

Run the respective runner files in the browser to get test results.

```bash
open SpecRunner.html
```
