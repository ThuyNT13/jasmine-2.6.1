# Jasmine framework for Behavior-Driven Development

Documentation [here](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html) but also a good quick start guide to Jasmine.

List of [Matchers](https://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers )

A few tutorials:

- [Jasmine â€“ JavaScript Unit Testing Tutorial with Examples](http://howtodoinjava.com/scripting/javascript/jasmine-javascript-unit-testing-tutorial/) is a nice overview of how to start using Jasmine and mentions how to disable certain specs.
- [Testing Your JavaScript with Jasmine](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine--net-21229) has some buggy sample tests -- as it's from 2011 -- but includes a sample test for throwing an exception.
- [Using Jasmine for JavaScript Testing ](http://blog.codeship.com/jasmine-testing-javascript/) short video tutorial
- [Unit Testing Best Practices in AngularJS](http://andyshora.com/unit-testing-best-practices-angularjs.html) has nice samples on _unit_ and _integration_ testing as well as discusses when to use them.

## Issues

When I set my specs with expectation returning a higher number first, it defaults all other specs to that number.

## Installation

[Download Jasmine framework](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)

Or fork this into your own project repo. The folder structure is currently setup how I prefer to use it for my projects.

Run the respective runner files in the browser to get test results.

```bash
open SpecRunner.html
```
